        Hello all! My name is Johan, and this website is dedicated to
        my love for homebrewing. Like so many others, the pandemic
        restrictions made me seek out new past-time activities that
        could be done from the comfort of my home.
        <br><br>
        I have always had a strong passion for beer, but it was not
        until recently I actually took a shot at brewing my own.
        <br><br>
        this website is in its essence an overview of my home brew. I
        hope you all will enjoy it, cheers!
      </p>
